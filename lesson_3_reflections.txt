When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    My Reflection: I would want to use a remote repository in the following situations: when I'm working on a project with a team, 
    when I am working on a project and know I'll be using multiple computers to work on the project, when I want to show
    someone some code I'm working on to get their opinion &/or help.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    My Reflection: the most obvious reason is that you may be working locally and your commits may not yet be
    ready to share with your team. If you're not quite done with a new feature sending a bunch of commits to GitHub
    might cause confusion and angst amongst your team.  This is just one of many reasons I can think of. What scares me 
    are the reasons I can't come up with right now.
