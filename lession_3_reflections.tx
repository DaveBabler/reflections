When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  My Reflection: I would want to use a remote repository in the following situations: when I'm working on a project with a team, 
  when I am working on a project and know I'll be using multiple computers to work on the project, when I want to show
  someone some code I'm working on to get their opinion &/or help.
